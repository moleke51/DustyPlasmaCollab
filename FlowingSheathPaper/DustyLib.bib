	Abstract = {Outline: Section 2 simply describes, without attempt at explanation, what happens electrically when a plasma is in contact with a solid surface. The practical implications of the interaction are briefly described. Section 3 provides a physical explanation of why these effects occur and deduces initial estimates of the plasma-solid voltage difference and the spatial extent of this voltage drop. Section 4 deduces the Bohm Criterion (ion drift velocity out of the plasma must equal the ion acoustic speed) using ion fluid models. The Criterion is obtained from both the plasma and the sheath equations separately. Section 5 deduces simple formulae for the particle and energy flux which is transmitted by a sheath, both for electrically floating and biased objects. Section 6 gives a brief indication of how the sheath particle and energy transmission characteristics influence the modeling of the edge plasma in magnetically confined plasma devices, while Section 7 gives a similar brief introduction to their use in the interpretation of plasma probe data.},

@article{ScepticFit,
	Abstract = {Dust immersed in plasma quickly charges to a potential where the ion and electron currents to it balance; this is the floating potential. In order to determine dust behaviour the floating potential must be known. The most used theory for determining this is orbital motion limited (OML). The OML floating potential depends on the ion to electron temperature ratio (β) and the plasma ion species (A). In reality the floating potential also depends strongly on the size of the dust grain (ρ = a/λD, where a is the radius of the grain and λD is the Debye length). Using a particle-in-cell code, dust is simulated in a collisionless plasma, the floating potential is investigated and the expressions provided allowing fast and accurate prediction of the floating potential as a function of β, A and ρ.},
