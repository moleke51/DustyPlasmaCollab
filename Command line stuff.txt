To set up your git software to use your account, use:
git config --global user.name (your github username)
git config --global user.email (your email here)

ls - list
cd - change directory
cd .. takes you up one file level


git add (filename) - stages a change to be committed
git commit -m "commit message" - commit changes to local repository
commiting change tells local computer that you like the change, saves it locally

git pull - pulls changes from online repository to local repository
git push - pushes local changes to online repository

To create a repository from an online one, use:
git clone (paste path here)

Cloning copies everything from the online repo into yours

To see the history of everything that has been committed, use:
git log

When working with other people,
1.  Commit your changes
2.  Pull changes everyone else made
3.  Resolve any conflicts
4.  Push your changes.


If you don't like using git through the terminal, use gitkraken instead for a fancy user interface.
